# WM_Inventory_Report 

Walmart inventory report gives non-technical, retail partners transparency into supply chain activities within a specific Walmart.com category assortment. The report groups items by buckets of business priorities (On order items, out-of-stock items, unproductive items, etc.). 

### How it works
The L3 Inventory Pull SQL file pulls data from Walmart's SQL database. The code organizes, cleans the data and is to be used with Heidi SQL's excel export feature to generate a report. An example report can be found in this repo.
